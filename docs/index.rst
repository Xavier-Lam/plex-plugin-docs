Plex Plugin Framework — Comprehensive API Reference
=====================================================

This is an API reference for the Plex Plugin Framework.

The official documentation is no longer available, but you can consult the
`archived version <https://web.archive.org/web/20150107154037/http://dev.plexapp.com/docs/index.html>`_
for additional context. That archived documentation lacks some details, so this
repository aims to provide a more comprehensive reference for Plex Plugin development.

This documentation is generated using ``Claude Opus 4.6`` from the source code under
``Framework.bundle/Contents/Resources/Versions/2/`` and may contain errors — if you
find any, please report them on `GitHub <https://github.com/Xavier-Lam/plex-plugin-docs>`_.
