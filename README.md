# Plex Plugin Framework — Comprehensive API Reference

It is a API reference for the Plex Plugin Framework. The documentation is hosted on [Read the Docs](https://plex-plugin-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and the source code of the documentation is on [Github](https://github.com/Xavier-Lam/plex-plugin-docs).

The official documentation is not available anymore, you can look up the [archived version](https://web.archive.org/web/20150107154037/http://dev.plexapp.com/docs/index.html) for more details. The documentation lacks some details, so I created this repository to provide a more comprehensive reference for the Plex Plugin development.

The documentation is generated from the source code under `Framework.bundle/Contents/Resources/Versions/2/`. It is generated by Claude Opus 4.6. It may contain some errors, if so, please report them.
